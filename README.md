# Bookstore CMS App Frontend with React and Redux

In this project React and Redux are used to build the front-end of the bookstore application that will help to the fictional bookseller company to organize and manage their bookstore. It must be fast, dynamic and responsive to user actions. Therefore I decided to build it with React & Redux. [The specific UI](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b35a9e13227086040f8eb75/screen/5b695e29bb8c844f118f9378) is implemented besides the functionality of the app. The github workflow, ESLint and Stylelint [linter guidlines by Microverse](linters-config/javascript at master ¬∑ m‚Ä¶) is followed.
